# Full Golang Tutorial [(Tech with Nana)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I)

In this full Golang course you will learn about one of the youngest programming languages that is becoming more and more popular in the cloud engineering world, which is Go or also commonly known as Golang. 
You will learn everything you need to get started with Go and start using it in your projects. We're going to write a very simple CLI application to learn the basics of Go. So instead of learning the concepts and syntax of Go with isolated examples, you will learn them while building an actual application throughout the tutorial.
